# multi-and-single-line-string-converter
Made for astronomy HW to store multiple large chunks of data for reference if needed.  This was a data table in Gsheets and the multiple lines stretched out the cells.  I only needed something functional, so this is NOT ELEGANT AT ALL.

The code acceses a file at the same level named input.txt.  Use toMulti.py and toSingle.py (both exacutables for python3) to switch text in input.txt between a messy single line and a beutiful multi-line. Messy because the "symbol" to seperate lines is: [(startofnewline)]. However, this is easibly changable in the code.
